# NaiveBayes_GUI
NaiveBayes Algorithm Implementaion with GUI to interact and load the data

Steps:

* [ ]  build GUI according to assignment instructions PDF
* [ ]  Naive Bayes :

  First we will develop each piece of the algorithm in this section, then we will tie all of the elements together into a working implementation applied to a real dataset in the     next section.

    This Naive Bayes tutorial is broken down into 5 parts:

   * [ ] Step 1: Separate By Class.
   * [ ] Step 2: Summarize Dataset.
   * [ ] Step 3: Summarize Data By Class.
   * [ ] Step 4: Gaussian Probability Density Function.
   * [ ] Step 5: Class Probabilities.
